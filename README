You will need gcc2 to build FINA.

To build:


gmake fast/slow x86/powerpc/mips posix
gmake

gmake is GNU make. Common names for it are also "gnumake" and "make".


When building, the following targets will be built:

fina0: barebones stage 0 compiler, generated by gforth

fina1: barebones stage 1 compiler, generated by fina0

fina2: barebones stage 2 compiler, generated by fina1, must be a
       bit-by-bit replica of fina1

fina: full compiler
