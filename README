Yes, this README sucks, but you know, it is still unreleased.

You will need gcc2 to build FINA. You will also need gforth-0.5.0 if
you want to add support for another architecture.

To build just run:

$ gmake

gmake is GNU make. Common names for it are also "gnumake" and "make".

You can force the location of temporary objects and the destination
directory:

$ gmake OBJDIR=/tmp/obj PREFIX=/usr/local

There's no separate install target. To install, just build to your
desired PREFIX.

It might happen that your system isn't supported. You'll get an error
like:

gmake[1]: *** No rule to make target `NetBSD-i386-xxx'.  Stop.

In that case, take a look at the Makefile.systems file and add a rule
for your system. If the architecture is supported and you're running a
posix system, it should be easy to get it working.

When building, the following targets will be built:

bootstrap: barebones bootstrap kernel, compiled from pregenerated assembler
        sources

kernel0: barebones stage 1 kernel, generated by bootstrap

kernel: barebones stage 2 kernel, generated by kernel0, must be a
        bit-by-bit replica of kernel0

fina: full compiler


What goes in the kernel?
- Set of words enough to bootstrap a full system _comfortably_
- Words that sooner or later will become primitives
