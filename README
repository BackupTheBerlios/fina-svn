Yes, this README sucks, but you know, it is still unreleased.

You will need gcc2 to build FINA.

To build:

gmake fast/slow x86/powerpc/mips posix
gmake

gmake is GNU make. Common names for it are also "gnumake" and "make".


When building, the following targets will be built:

bootstrap: barebones bootstrap kernel, compiled from pregenerated assembler
        sources

kernel0: barebones stage 1 kernel, generated by bootstrap

kernel: barebones stage 2 kernel, generated by kernel0, must be a
        bit-by-bit replica of kernel0

fina: full compiler


What goes in the kernel?
- Set of words enough to bootstrap a full system _comfortably_
- Words that sooner or later will become primitives
